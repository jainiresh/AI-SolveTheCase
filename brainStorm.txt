LEts play a game

Ill share you details about my day,  like
 - whom all i met ?
 - what they do ?
 - i occasionally also provide at which circumstance/instance i met them today.
 - where i met thim ?
 - when i met them ?
etc.,.,

Assume all of these is happening in my town.
form a crime story, where a person gets murdered in our town, and make one of the people i met the murderer, dont tell me who.

Form a clear reason, it can include details that was made up by you , or unrelated to the details i have mentioned, about why the murderer murdered the man.

Give me hints , and i need to figure out who the murderer is and eventually end up guessing your story's guilty person.

There must be only one answer, who is the murderer and one reason that he did it.
You can yourself make situations to people, even if i have not mentioned it.

if i guess incorrectly, tell me im wrong too.



Morning i woke up, and my gardener was watering my plants .
He was cheerful as everyday, singing while watering the plants.

I got up and took up my laptop.
My friend Antony called, but when i picked up he did not speak, and the call got disconnected in a few seconds.

Then i worked up to noon, then my maiden came and collected all my clothes.
She did not speak to me properly, and she told that it was a family problem so i did not ask deeper details from her.

Then evening i went to the gym , my trainer ALI was there, also working out with his other friends Veronica, and Saru.

I went to the medical shop, and bought some digestive tablets, as i had some stomach ache.
The person in the reception was a bit sad, but was working seriously.

Then i came home, and slept
